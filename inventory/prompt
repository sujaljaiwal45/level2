## 🤖 AI Prompts Used

Here is the sequence of prompts I used to build this inventory management dashboard:

**Prompt 1: Core App & Data Structure**
> "Write a Python web application using Streamlit for an inventory management dashboard. It should be for a safety products business called 'Amar Store: Safety Inventory'. Use local CSV files to store the data (`amar_store_inventory.csv` and `amar_store_categories.csv`). Set up default categories like Boiler Suits, Safety Shoes, Helmets, and Gloves. Create a sidebar navigation with two pages: 'Inventory Dashboard' and 'Manage Categories'."

**Prompt 2: Inventory Logic & UI**
> "On the Inventory Dashboard, add a sidebar form to create new products. It should allow me to select a category, enter a product name, input multiple sizes separated by commas, and set an initial stock amount. Also, include a tab to add new size variants to existing products. Display the current inventory in the main view grouped by category. For each product variant, show the size, the current stock in red if it's below 5, and include '+' and '-' buttons to easily update the stock levels. Add buttons to delete specific sizes or entire products."

**Prompt 3: History Logging & Shop Health**
> "Now, upgrade the app by adding a 'History Log' page. Create a function that logs every action (like 'Created', 'Stock In', 'Stock Out', or 'Deleted') along with a timestamp and the stock change into a new file called `amar_store_history.csv`. Display this history on the new page with a search bar and a button to download the CSV. Finally, add a 'Shop Health' summary at the very top of the main inventory page showing the total items in stock and a warning alert if any variants drop below 5 items."
